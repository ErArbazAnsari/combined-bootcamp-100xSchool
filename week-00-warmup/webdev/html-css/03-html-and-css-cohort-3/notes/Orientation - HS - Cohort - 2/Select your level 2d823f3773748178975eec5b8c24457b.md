# Select your level

### Complete beginner (very basic/no coding before)

Things will be hard. You should spend ~20 hours/week atleast on Cohort material, assignments, other content covering what we’re doing in the Cohort. Don’t slack off

### Intermediate (Done basic JS, HTML and some DSA)

You should be for the first ~10 weeks or so. We see major drop off after the first major project. 

Try chewing some glass after week 10, that is where you will actually learn things that differentiate you from a typical MERN developer

### Advance (Know MERN decent/well)

Feel free to drop off for the first few weeks. I’ll see you on Github. Participate in the Superteam hackathon , aim for GSoC this year. Already start looking at orgs
